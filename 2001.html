 The design, implementation, and evaluation of INCA: a proposal for
  an automated system for approval code allocation.
 M.S. Thesis Proposal CSDL-01-11, Department of Information and
  Computer Sciences, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, September

<blockquote><font size="-1">

The ICS department of the University of Hawaii has faced problems
surrounding approval code distribution as its enrollment has increased. The
manual system for approval code allocation was time-consuming, ineffective
and inefficient. INCA is designed to automate the task of approval code
allocation, improve the quality of course approval decisions, and decrease
the administrative overhead involved in those decisions.

Based upon informal feedback from department administrators, it appears
that INCA reduces their overhead and makes their life easier. What are the
old problems that are solved by INCA? Does INCA introduce new kinds of
problems for the administrator? What about the students? Are they
completely satisfied with the system? In what ways does the system benefit
the department as a whole?

In this thesis, I will discuss design, implementation and evaluation of
INCA. I will evaluate INCA from the viewpoints of students, administrators,
and the department. I will do an email analysis to prove that INCA reduces
the administrative overheads. I will conduct a user survey to investigate
whether INCA improves the predictability and understandability of
students. Finally, I will analyze the INCA database to extract the
information useful to the departments for course curriculum planning. The
evaluation of INCA will provide us with useful insights for future
improvements of INCA and improving the student experience with academic
systems in general.

 Lightweight disaster management training and control.
 M.S. Thesis Proposal CSDL-01-07, Department of Information and
  Computer Sciences, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, July 2001.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

Disaster management is increasingly a global enterprise for international
organizations,  governmental institutions, and arguably individuals.  The
tempo at which information is  collected and disseminated during natural
and man-made disasters paces the rate and  effectiveness of relief
efforts.  As the Internet becomes a ubiquitous platform for sharing
information, a browser-based application can provide disaster managers a
lightweight  solution for training and control.  A heavyweight solution
might include dedicated  communications, real-time command and control
software and hardware configurations,  and dedicated personnel.  In
contrast, a lightweight solution requires trained personnel  with Internet
access to a server via computers or hand-held devices.  Tsunami Sim
provides asynchronous situational awareness with an interactive, Geographic
Information  System (GIS).  Tsunami Sim is not capable of providing
real-time situational awareness  nor intended to replace or compete with
heavyweight solutions developed for that  purpose.  Rather, Tsunami Sim
will enhance the disaster managers' abilities to train for  and control
disasters in regions where heavyweight solutions are impractical.  For
distributed training, Tsunami Sim will provide deterministic and stochastic
scenarios of  historical and fictional disasters.  Tsunami Sim will be an
open-source, Java application  implemented for maintainability and
extensibility.  United States Pacific Command  (PACOM) located at Camp
Smith, Hawai'i, will enable Tsunami Sim validation and  assessment.

 Vendor relationship management: Re-engineering the business process
  through B2B infrastructure to accelerate the growth of small businesses in
  geographically isolated areas.
 Technical Report CSDL-01-10, Department of Information and Computer
  Sciences, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, December 2001.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

Instead of limiting the business to the local populace, the World Wide Web
gives global access to all companies that have made the transition to
online.  Ideally, the Internet seems to offer vast, untapped markets,
lowers the costs of reaching these markets, and frees businesses from
geographical constraints. Applying this to Hawaii, small companies can now
sell their products in the expanding global marketplace, instead of
restricting themselves to an island economy.

The goal of research on the Vendor Relationship Management (VRM) System
is to explore the requirements for new business process models and
associated technological infrastructure for small local businesses in
Hawaii that wish to exploit the global reach of the Internet.  In order to
understand the requirements and potential of this approach, we had meetings
with different groups of people that included the host of a virtual mall, a
financial service provider, two courier services, and several local
companies.

The interface of the VRM system includes both a vendor and a host
 side. The host side is used by the virtual mall company to send customers
 orders to the various vendors. It can also be used to create and edit
 vendor company information, create and edit vendor product information,
 and enter a contact email address. The vendor side is used by the numerous
 vendors to receive the orders, confirm that the orders have been sent,
 view the customer information, create and edit product information, and
 create and edit contact information.

After creating the first prototype, several experts gave their critiques
of the system. Based on their critiques, we came up with several possible
directions for future research.

 You can't even ask them to push a button: Toward ubiquitous,
  developer-centric, empirical software engineering.
 In <em>The NSF Workshop for New Visions for Software Design and
  Productivity: Research and Applications</em>, Nashville, TN, December 2001.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

Collection and analysis of empirical software project data is central to
modern techniques for improving software quality, programmer productivity,
and the economics of software project development. Unfortunately, barriers
surrounding the cost, quality, and utility of empirical project data
hamper effective collection and application in many software
development organizations.

This paper describes Hackystat, an approach to enabling ubiquitous
collection and analysis of empirical software project data. The approach
rests on three design criteria: data collection and analysis must be
developer-centric rather than management-centric; it must be in-process
rather than between-process, and it must be non-disruptive-it must not
require developers to interrupt their activities to collect and/or analyze
data.  Hackystat is being implemented via an open source, sensor and web
service based architecture.  After a developer instruments their commercial
development environment tools (such as their compiler, editor, version
control system, and so forth) with Hackystat sensors, data is silently and
unobtrusively collected and sent to a centralized web service.  The web
service runs analysis mechanisms over the data and sends email
notifications back to a developer when &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; changes in their
process or product occur.

Our research so far has yielded an initial operational release in daily use
with a small set of sensors and analysis mechanisms, and a research agenda
for expansion in the tools, the sensor data types, and the analyses. Our
research has also identified several critical technical and social
barriers, including: the fidelity of the sensors; the coverage of the
sensors; the APIs exposed by commercial tools for instrumentation; and the
security and privacy considerations required to avoid adoption problems due
to the spectre of &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo;.

Collection and analysis of empirical software project data is central to
modern techniques for improving software quality, programmer productivity,
and the economics of software project development.  Unfortunately,
effective collection and analysis of software project data is rare in
mainstream software development. Prior research suggests that three primary
barriers are: (1) cost: gathering empirical software engineering
project data is frequently expensive in resources and time; (2)
  quality: it is often difficult to validate the accuracy of the data; and
(3) utility: many metrics programs succeed in collecting data but
fail to make that data useful to developers.

This report describes Hackystat, a technology initiative and research
project that explores the strengths and weaknesses of a
  developer-centric, in-process, and non-disruptive approach
to validation of empirical software project data collection and analysis.

 An artificial neural network for recognition of simulated dolphin
  whistles.
 M.S. Thesis CSDL-01-14, Department of Information and Computer
  Sciences, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, May 2001.
[&nbsp;<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2001/01-14/01-14.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">

It is known that dolphins are capable of understanding 200 "word"
vocabularies with sentence complexity of three or more "words", where
words consist of audio tones or hand gestures. An automated recognition
method of words where a word is a defined whistle, within a
predetermined acceptable degree of variance, could allow words to  be
both easily reproducible by dolphins and identifiable by humans. We
investigate a neural network to attempt to distinguish four
artificially  generated whistles from themselves and from common
underwater  environmental noises, where a whistle consists of four
variations of a  fundamental whistle style. We play these whistle
variations into the  dolphins normal tank environment and then record
from a separate  tank hydrophone. This results in slight differences for
each whistle  variation's spectrogram, the complete collection of which
we use to  form the neural network training set. For a single whistle
variation, the  neural network demonstrates strong output node values,
greater than  0.9 on a scale of 0 to 1. However, for combinations of
"words", the network exhibits poor training
performance and an  inability to distinguish between words. To validate
this, we used a test set of 41 examples, of which only 22 were
correctly classified. This  result suggests that an appropriately
trained backpropagation neural  network using spectrographic analysis as
inputs is a viable means for a  very specific whistle recognition,
however a large degree of whistle  variation will dramatically lower the
performance of the network, past  that required for acceptable
recognition.

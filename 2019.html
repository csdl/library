Capturing and classifying power quality phenomena is important for the smooth functioning of electrical grids.  This paper presents methods for classifying the four types of transients (impulsive, arcing, oscillatory, and periodic notching) specified in the IEEE 1159 Power Quality standard. Our methods implement a tractable algorithm, which applies well understood signal processing methods and statistical inference for feature extraction and decision making. We tested our methods on simulated power quality disturbances in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. The results of this research include an operational implementation of a transient classifier for Open Power Quality, an open source distributed power quality network. Additional functionality can be easily incorporated into the system to extend the utility of our methods, such as a meta-analysis to capture higher level network wide events.

Modern web application development provides an attractive application area for introductory software engineering education, as students have direct experience with the domain and it provides them with the potential to gain practical, real-world skills. Achieving this potential requires the development of competency with a multiple component tech stack for web application development, which is challenging to acquire within a single semester. In this research, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a new pedagogy called “athletic software engineering” which is intended to help students efficiently and effectively acquire competency with a multiple component tech stack as a precursor to a web application development project. We evaluated the pedagogy over 4 years and six semesters with 286 students and found strong evidence for its effectiveness.

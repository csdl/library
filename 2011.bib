The Kukui Cup is an advanced dorm energy competition whose goal is to
investigate the relationships among energy literacy, sustained energy
conservation, and information technology support of behavior change. Two
general purpose open source systems have been implemented: WattDepot and
Makahiki. WattDepot provides enterprise-level collection, storage, analysis,
and visualization of energy data. Makahiki is a web application framework that
supports dorm energy competitions of varying degrees of complexity,
including a personalized homepage where participants can complete tasks
designed to increase energy literacy that can be verified by competition
administrators. The technology and approach will be evaluated in a dorm energy
competition to take place in the Spring of 2011, with hundreds of University
freshmen. The energy use of each pair of dormitory floors will be metered in
near-realtime, and the energy literacy of participants will be assessed before
and after the competition.

Our research seeks to investigate the relationships
among energy literacy, sustained energy conservation,
and information technology support of behavior change
through an advanced dorm energy competition to take
place in Fall 2011. Game design techniques are used to
attract competition participants, keep them engaged,
and have a lasting impact in their energy use behavior
through retained knowledge of energy obtained via the
game environment.

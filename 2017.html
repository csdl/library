<blockquote><font size="-1">
Sensor networks are spatially distributed autonomous sensors that monitor the physical world around them and often communicate those reading over a network to a server or servers. Sensor networks can benefit from the generally “unlimited resources” of the cloud, namely processing, storage, and network resources. This literature review surveys the major components of distributed data management, namely, cloud computing, distributed persistence models, and distributed analytics.

 Compression and compressed sensing in bandwidth constrained sensor
  networks.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Improvements in sensor and radio technologies allow for creation of cheap sensors interconnected via radio links and the Internet. These advancements opened the door for creation of large area autonomous monitoring networks referred to as sensor networks. Bandwidth requirements of a wireless sensor network has a direct effect on its performance. This paper describes three bandwidth reduction methods: lossless compression, lossy compression, and compressed sensing.

 Opq version 2: An architecture for distributed, real-time, high

<blockquote><font size="-1">
OpenPowerQuality (OPQ) is a framework that supports end-to-end capture, analysis, and visualizations of distributed real-time power quality (PQ) data. Version 2 of OPQ builds on version 1 by providing higher sampling rates, optional battery backup, end-to-end security, GPS synchronization, pluggable analysis, and a real-time visualization framework. OPQ provides real-time distributed power measurements which allows users to see both local PQ events and grid-wide PQ events. The OPQ project has three principal components: back-end hardware for making power measurements, middleware for data acquisition and analysis, and a front-end providing visualizations. OPQBox2 is a hardware platform that takes PQ measurements, provides onboard analysis, and securely transfers data to our middleware. The OPQ middleware performs filtering on the OPQBox2 sensor data and performs high-level PQ analysis. The results of our PQ analysis and real-time state of the sensor network are displayed using OPQView. We’ve collected distributed PQ datafrom locations across Oahu, Hawaii and have demonstrated our ability to detect both local and grid-wide power quality events.

 RADGRAD: Using degree planning, social networking, and gamification
  to improve academic, professional, and social engagement during the
  undergraduate computer science degree experience.
 Technical Report CSDL-17-05, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI,
  July 2017.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
A casual analysis of the Hawaii technology community site, TechHui, suggests that over the past decade, recent alumni and current undergraduates of the Information and Computer Science (ICS) program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) have experienced several problems with various academic, professional, and social aspects of their ICS experience. Existing degree planning systems such as STAR, Starfish by Hobsons, Blackboard Planner and Coursicle fail to provide the specific support that ICS students need to create a complete and comprehensive degree plan. Existing academic social networks such as LinkedIn, TechHui and Rate My Professors fail to connect students closely with professors and alumni. Current popular video games suggest that several gamification features could encourage ICS students to achieve higher goals. A new system called RadGrad combines degree planning, social networking, and gamification in a novel way that aims to give ICS undergraduates the support they need to succeed and redefines what it means to have a successful degree experience. The overall goal of this thesis is to justify the initial RadGrad system design and establish baseline values for future studies. A baseline student survey conducted in Spring 2017 reveals current and more detailed student perceptions on the academic, professional, and social aspects of the ICS degree experience prior to using RadGrad. These baseline results can be used in a future study to measure if RadGrad has had any effects on the students.

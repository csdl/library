The Personal Environmental Tracker (PET) is a proposed
system for helping people to track their impact on the
environment, and to make changes to reduce that impact,
creating a personal feedback loop. PET consists of sensors
that collect data such as home electricity or gasoline usage
and send it to a database for analysis and presentation to the
user. By collecting data from diverse sources, PET can help
users decide what aspect of their lives they should make
changes in first to maximize their reduction in
environmental impact. PET's open architecture will allow
other ubiquitous sustainability researchers to leverage the
infrastructure for research in sensors, data analysis, or
presentation of data.

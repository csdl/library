We designed the Kukui Cup challenge to foster energy conservation and increase energy literacy. Based on a review of the literature, the challenge combined a variety of elements into an overall game experience, including: real-time energy feedback, goals, commitments, competition, and prizes.

We designed a software system called Makahiki to provide the online portion of the Kukui Cup challenge. Energy use was monitored by smart meters installed on each floor of the Hale Aloha residence halls on the University of Hawai`i at Manoa campus.

In October 2011, we ran the UH Kukui Cup challenge for the over 1000 residents of the Hale Aloha towers. To evaluate the Kukui Cup challenge, I conducted three experiments: challenge participation, energy literacy, and energy use.

Many residents participated in the challenge, as measured by points earned and actions completed through the challenge website. I measured the energy literacy of a random sample of Hale Aloha residents using an online energy literacy questionnaire administered before and after the challenge. I found that challenge participants' energy knowledge increased significantly compared to non-challenge participants. Positive self-reported energy behaviors increased after the challenge for both challenge participants and non-participants, leading to the possibility of passive participation by the non-challenge participants.

I found that energy use varied substantially between and within lounges over time. Variations in energy use over time complicated the selection of a baseline of energy use to compare the levels during and after the challenge. The best team reduced its energy use during the challenge by 16\%. However, team energy conservation did not appear to correlate to participation in the challenge, and there was no evidence of sustained energy conservation after the challenge. The problems inherent in assessing energy conservation using a baseline call into question this common practice.

My research has generated several contributions, including: a demonstration of increased energy literacy as a result of the challenge, the discovery of fundamental problems with the use of baselines for assessing energy competitions, the creation of two open source software systems, and the creation of an energy literacy assessment instrument.

Satisfying the radically different requirements and operating assumptions of the next generation smart grid requires new kinds of software that enable research and experimentation into the ways that electrical energy production and consumption can be collected, analyzed, visualized, and provided to consumers. Since 2009, we have been designing, implementing, and evaluating an open source software ``stack'' to facilitate this research. This software stack consists of two custom systems called WattDepot and Makahiki, along with the open source components they rely upon (Java, Restlet, Postgres, Python, Django, Memcache). In this paper, we detail the novel features of WattDepot and Makahiki, our experiences using them for research and education, and additional ways they can be used for next generation energy research and education.

For more than 15 years, researchers at
the Collaborative Software Development
Laboratory (CSDL) at the University
of Hawaii at Manoa have looked
for analytics that help developers
understand and improve development
processes and products. Through this
research, we’ve come to believe that the
“searching under the streetlight” metaphor
is useful for understanding both
our research and that of others in this
area.

To achieve the full benefits of the Smart Grid, end users must become active participants in the energy ecosystem. This paper presents the Kukui Cup challenge, a serious game designed around the topic of energy conservation which incorporates a variety of energy feedback visualizations, a multifaceted serious game with online educational activities, and real-world activities such as workshops and excursions. We describe our experiences in developing energy feedback visualizations in the Kukui Cup based on in-lab evaluations and field studies in college residence halls. We learned that energy feedback systems should address these factors: they should be actionable, that domain knowledge must go hand in hand with energy feedback systems, and that this feedback must be ``sticky'' to lead to changes in behaviors and attitudes.

  abstract = { The usability of an application is a measure of how effectively it can be
               used to perform the tasks it was designed for in its target
               environment. A user interface the toolbars, menus, and other elements
               that control an application determines how quickly and correctly users
               can complete tasks. Makahiki is an application framework for designing
               serious games (games which teach a serious subject) focused on energy
               conservation, recycling, and clean energy issues. A problem with the
               current iteration of Makahiki is that creating competitions in its
               administrator interface is time-consuming. To identify the reasons for
               this problem, I will work with the Makahiki development team to
               distribute surveys to identify usability issues.  For the first survey,
               University of Hawai‘i at M¯anoa students will configure Makahiki for a
               course assignment, self-report the time required for each part of the
               configuration, and describe usability problems. I will develop a design
               tool that will address these problems.  After the design tool is
               completed, some of the first surveys questions will be reused with a
               second group of test subjects, comparing their performance with the
               design tool against the first groups performance with the original
               application on a subset of the same tasks. This will determine if
               configuration times decreased and the usability issues of the original
               application were addressed by the redesign. The collection of usability
               data and the creation of the design tool will address Makahikis
               usability problems while enhancing the understanding of how user
               interface design styles affect usability.  }

Assessment of serious game frameworks is emerging as an
important area of research. This paper describes an assessment
mechanism called the Serious Game Stakeholder Experience
Assessment Method (SGSEAM). SGSEAM is designed
to provide detailed insights into the strengths and
shortcomings of serious game frameworks through a stakeholder
perspective based approach. In this paper, we report on
the use of SGSEAM to assess Makahiki, an open source serious
game framework for sustainability. Our results provide
useful insights into both Makahiki as a serious game framework
and SGSEAM as an assessment method.

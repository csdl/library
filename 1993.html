<blockquote><font size="-1">
Formal technical review (FTR) is a cornerstone of software quality
assurance.  However, the labor intensive and manual nature of review, along
with basic unresolved questions about its process and products, means that
review is typically under-utilized or inefficiently applied within the
software development process. This paper introduces CSRS, a
computer-supported cooperative work environment for software review that
improves the efficiency of review activities and supports empirical
investigation of the appropriate parameters for review. The paper presents
a typical scenario of CSRS in review, its data and process model,
application to process maturation, relationship to other research, current
status, and future directions.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
This research concerns the representation issue in collaborative learning
environments. Our basic claim is that knowledge representation is not only
fundamental to machine learning, as shown by AI researchers, but also
essential to human learning, in particular, human metalearning.  Few
existing learning support systems, however, provide representations which
help the learner make sense of and organize the subject content of
learning, integrate a wide range of classroom activities, (e.g., reading,
reviewing, writing, discussion), and compare and contrast various
viewpoints from individual learners.  It is our primary purpose to
construct an example instance of such a representation, and to show that
useful computational manipulations can be performed on it, and that the
combination of the representation and related computational services can
actually lead to the improved learner's performance on selected
collaborative learning tasks.

 Experiences with CSRS: An instrumented software review environment.

breadth and depth of information captured per person-hour of review time,
and that its design captures interesting measures of review process,
products, and effort.

 Studying formal technical review methods using CSRS.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The importance of formal technical review and its benefits have been
well documented, and yet there is a proliferation of methods in
practice with varying degrees of success.

This paper discusses a new approach to assess and study various
aspects associated with the effectiveness of current review methods.
Our basic approach is to use a computer assisted review system (CSRS)
equipped with mechanisms to model different review methods and
at the same time capture fine-grained measurements
about the product and the process of the review.
Through suitable experimental design, these data can be used to
compare the different methods to each other.

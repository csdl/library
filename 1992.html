 Supporting exploratory CSCW with the EGRET framework.
 In <em>Proceedings of the 1992 Conference on Computer Supported
  Cooperative Work</em>, November 1992.
<blockquote><font size="-1">
Exploratory collaboration occurs in domains where the structure and process
of group work evolves as an intrinsic part of the collaborative activity.
Traditional database and hypertext structural models do not provide
explicit support for collaborative exploration.  The EGRET framework
defines both a data and a process model along with supporting analysis
techniques that provide novel support for exploratory collaboration.  To do
so, the EGRET framework breaks with traditional notions of the relationship
between schema and instance structure.  In EGRET, schema structure is
viewed as a representation of the current state of consensus among
collaborators, from which instance structure is allowed to depart in a
controlled fashion.  This paper discusses the issues of exploratory
collaboration, the EGRET approach to its support, and the current status of
this research.

 Supporting scientific learning and research review using COREVIEW.
 In <em>Proceedings of the 1992 AAAI Workshop on Communicating
  Scientific and Technical Knowledge</em>, July 1992.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Scientific learning and research are becoming increasingly
  computerized. More and more such activities are mediated through
  electronic artifacts. This paper presents an artifact-based system
  called COREVIEW, to be used in the domain of research seminars. The
  emphasis of our approach is on the centrality of textualized artifacts
  in seminar activities, the relationship between different types of
  artifacts, and the dynamic interactions among them over time. Our
  system provides explicit representation of research artifacts and their
  structures, and support for the process of collaborative artifact
  generation, integration, manipulation and utilization.

 Operational definition and automated inference of test-driven
  development with Zorro.
 <em>Journal of Automated Software Engineering</em>, December 2009.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

Test-driven development (TDD) is a style of development named for its most
visible characteristic: the design and implementation of test cases prior
to the implementation of the code required to make them pass. Many claims
have been made for TDD: that it can improve implementation as well as
design quality, that it can improve productivity, that it results in 100%
coverage, and so forth.  However, research to validate these claims has
yielded mixed and sometimes contradictory results.  We believe that at
least part of the reason for these results stems from differing
interpretations of the TDD development style, along with an inability to
determine whether programmers actually follow whatever definition of
TDD is in use.

Zorro is a system designed to automatically determine whether a developer
is complying with an operational definition of Test-Driven Development
(TDD) practices.  Automated recognition of TDD can benefit the software
development community in a variety of ways, from inquiry into the &ldquo;true
nature&rdquo; of TDD, to pedagogical aids to support the practice of test-driven
development, to support for more rigorous empirical studies on the
effectiveness of TDD in both laboratory and real world settings.

This paper describes the Zorro system, its operational definition of TDD,
the analyses made possible by Zorro, and two empirical evaluations of the
system.  Our research shows that it is possible to define an operational
definition of TDD that is amenable to automated recognition, and
illustrates the architectural and design issues that must be addressed in
order to do so.  Zorro has implications not only for the practice of TDD,
but also for software engineering &ldquo;micro-process&rdquo; definition and
recognition through its parent framework, Software Development Stream
Analysis.

 We need more coverage, stat! Experience with the software ICU.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

For empirical software engineering to reach its fullest potential, we must
develop effective, experiential approaches to learning about it in a
classroom setting.  In this paper, we report on a case study involving a
new approach to classroom-based empirical software engineering called the
&ldquo;Software ICU&rdquo;.  In this approach, students learn about nine empirical
project &ldquo;vital signs&rdquo; and use the Hackystat Framework to put their
projects into a virtual &ldquo;intensive care unit&rdquo; where these vital signs can
be assessed and monitored.  We used both questionnaire and log data to gain
insight into the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Our evaluation
provides both quantitative and qualitative evidence concerning the overhead
of the system; the relative utility of different vital signs; the frequency
of use; and the perceived appropriateness outside of the classroom
setting. In addition to benefits, we found evidence of measurement
dysfunction induced directly by the presence of the Software ICU. We
compare these results to case studies we performed in 2003 and 2006 using
the Hackystat Framework but not the Software ICU.  We use these findings to
orient future research on empirical software engineering both inside and
outside of the classroom.

This report presents the results from a classroom evaluation of Hackystat
by ICS 413 students at the end of Fall, 2008.  The evaluation focuses on
the use of the Software ICU user interface developed using Hackystat Version 8.
Results indicate that sensor installation is somewhat more complicated than
previously due to the absence of a client-side installer.  The three most
used "vital signs" were DevTime, Coverage, and Commit.  Over half of the respondents
felt that the Software ICU colors accurately represented the health of the project.
Most students felt that the Software ICU would be useful in a professional context.

Hackystat is an open source framework for automated collection and analysis
of software engineering process and product data.  Hackystat has been in
development since 2001, and has gone through eight major architectural
revisions during that time.  In 2007, we performed the latest architectural
revision, whose primary goal was to reimplement Hackystat as a
service-oriented architecture (SOA).  This version has now been in
public release for a year, and this paper reports on our experiences:

Similarity search in time-series databases has become an active research area in the past decade
due to the tremendous growth of the amount of temporal data collected and publicly available.
The complexity of this similarity problem lies in the high dimensionality of the temporal data
making convenient methods inappropriate. The most promising approaches involve dimensionality
reduction and indexing techniques which are the subject of this review. After starting with a
general introduction to the time-series and classical time-series analyses, we will discuss in detail
time-series normalization techniques and relevant distance metrics. We conclude with a review of
the dimensionality-reduction and indexing methods proposed to date.

In this research, I will apply knowledge discovery and data mining techniques to the domain of software engineering in order to evaluate their ability to automatically notice interesting recurrent patterns of behavior. While I am not proposing to be able to infer a complete and correct software process model, my system will provide its users with a formal description of recurrent behaviors in their software development. The proposed contributions of my research will include:  (1) the implementation of a system aiding in discovery of novel software process knowledge through the analysis of fine-grained software process and product data;
(2) experimental evaluation of the system, which will provide insight into its strengths and weaknesses;
and (3) the possible discovery of useful new software process patterns.

 Learning empirical software engineering using software intensive care

<blockquote><font size="-1">

In software engineering, the importance of measurement is well understood, and many efficient software development metrics have been developed to help measurement. However, as the number of metrics increases, the effort required to collect data, analyze them and interpret the results quickly becomes overwhelming. This problem is even more critical in educational approaches regarding empirical software engineering.

The Software Intensive Care Unit is a new approach to facilitating software measurement and control with multiple software development metrics. It uses the Hackystat system to achieve automated data collection and analysis, then uses the collected analysis data to create a monitoring interface for multiple &ldquo;vital signs&rdquo;. A vital sign is a wrapper of a software metric with an easy to use presentation. It consists of a historical trend and a newest state value, both of which are colored according to the &ldquo;health&rdquo; state.

My research deployed and evaluated the Software ICU in a senior-level software engineering course. Students' usage was logged in the system, and a survey was conducted. The results provide supporting evidence that Software ICU does help students in course project development and project team organization. In addition, the results of the study also discover some limitations of the system, including inappropriate vital sign presentation and measurement dysfunction.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

The University of Hawaii at Manoa has set the goals of reducing its
electricity usage by 30 percent by 2012 and 50 percent by 2015 (based on a
2003 benchmark). A variety of tactics will be required to meet these
aggressive goals. One promising technique is to encourage the occupants of
buildings to reduce their electricity usage.  There are a variety of
possible interventions that may encourage occupants to reduce their
electricity usage. To assess the relative effectiveness of the
interventions, we plan a series of experiments in Saunders. However, the
participants of each experiment will be the occupants of Saunders, rather
than a set of participants recruited anew for each experiment. We expect
two negative consequences of the continuity of the subjects: reduced
subject interest/enthusiasm, and diminishing conservation returns.

 Human centered information integration for the smart grid.
 Technical Report CSDL-09-15, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI,

<blockquote><font size="-1">

The "Smart Grid" represents a new vision for
the electrical infrastructure of the United States, whose goals include
more active participation by consumers, new generation and storage options
including renewable energy, and new products, services, and markets.  To
reach its full potential, the Smart Grid must provide information to
consumers in a way that enables positive, sustained changes to
energy-related behaviors.

The central question to be pursued in this research proposal is: What kinds of
  information, provided in what ways and at what times, enables consumers
  to make positive, sustained changes to their energy consumption
  behaviors?  Prior research indicates that such changes can potentially
be motivated by an appropriate combination of personalized information,
general and specific commitments, achievable goals, social reinforcement,
feedback, and financial incentives.

This project will develop a collection
of open source components called WattBlocks, which  will provide novel and
useful scientific infrastructure for investigating the ways in which
energy-related information can affect human behavior. The project will also
develop eSpheres, a novel social networking application that provides users
with access to energy-related communities at configurable levels of
scale. The combination of WattBlocks and eSpheres will lower the technological
efforts required for empirical, replicable studies of human energy-related
behaviors.

The project will use this infrastructure in a series of two case studies, one
involving campus dormitory energy competitions and one involving community
home energy challenges.  The project will investigate a number of
important research questions, including: (1) What are the requirements
for consumer-facing, open source, scientific energy information
infrastructure? (2) What are the strengths and weaknesses of a dedicated
social network technology like eSpheres for energy behavior change? (3)
What combination of behavioral change motivators, under what conditions,
induce positive change? (4) What factors influence the sustainability of
these changes? (5) What is the influence of energy data feedback latency
(i.e. 1 minute, 15 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day) on behavioral change?

<blockquote><font size="-1">

This thesis investigates a new way to take advantage of RDF metadata to
support Collaborative Software Development. RDF metadata helps developers
overcome typical problems in iterative software development, such as:
exceptions thrown at run-time; making design and implementation decisions
within previously unknown domains; and usage of previously unknown tools or
libraries. Solutions usually consist of searching for suggestions from
forum posts, source code of similar projects, direct contact with specific
experts, etc.  The main problems with this approach are the time wasted in
manually detecting the searched info from unstructured documents, the low
effectiveness of search engines, and the lack of information about the
actual expertise of the directly contacted people.

In contrast, having info about projects and issues semantically structured
with RDF metadata can speed up detection of the searched details.  Dynamic
creation of RDF links with external similar RDF metadata allows users to
avoid searching or analyzing search results.  Finally, metadata about users
including quality measures coming from a trustworthy source such as
Telemetry can allow the user to trust the actual developer's
expertise. Such RDF metadata and links, together with HTTP URIs, is
provided by the Hackystat LinkedSensorData (LiSeD) service.

 Applying case-based reasoning for building autonomic service-oriented
  systems.
 Technical Report CSDL-09-17, University of Limerick, Ireland,
  September 2009.
[&nbsp;<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2009/09-17/09-17.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">

Service-oriented computing is considered as a successful approach building
large-scale software systems, spanning the internet, and globally improving
software reuse. Service-oriented architectures are complex and hard to
maintain. A service may run on many machines, and single machines may host
many services. The concept of distributed composition of services hides a
huge amount of complexity in the management of the service-oriented
architecture. Users have to deal with complex configuration of services to
achieve functional and quality requirements, thus the complexity of the
system requires a lot of administrator-interference. Despite the effort of
the administrator, the configuration may not be good enough. It is hard for
an administrator to monitor individual services and the service-oriented
system to determine if the system is running optimal. Therefore a growing
trend for autonomic service-oriented systems has emerged. In mid-october
2001, IBM released a manifesto that the main obstacle to further progress
in the IT industry is a looming software complexity crisis. The manifesto
claimed that the difficulty of managing today's computer systems goes well
beyond the administration of individual software environments. Computing
system's complexity appears to be approaching the limits of human
capability, and there will be no way to make timely, decisive responses to
the rapid stream of changing and conflicting. This dissertation discusses
autonomic computing in service-oriented computing. We present a framework
that builds the foundation for self-healing, self-reconfiguration,
self-optimization and selfprotecting service-oriented systems. We apply and
implement the framework to Hackystat, an Open Source Software developed at
University of Hawaii. Furthermore we discuss the role of service-oriented
computing in autonomic computing, which plays a fundamental role for the
relationship between autonomic elements. At the end, we achieved to provide
a global overview in the domain of autonomic and service-oriented computing
and how to combine them in bidirectional ways. We implemented an open
source framework called, Hackystat Service Manager, for achieving an
autonomic service-oriented architecture in Hackystat in the scope of Google
Summer of Code, which can be evolved and evaluated or adapted to any other
service-oriented system.

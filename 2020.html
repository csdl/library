RadGrad is a curriculum initiative implemented via a web-based application that combines features of social networks, degree planners, and serious games. RadGrad redefines the traditional meaning of &ldquo;progress&rdquo; and &ldquo;success&rdquo; in the undergraduate computer science degree program, with the ultimate goal of improving student engagement, diversity, and retention.  In this paper, we relate RadGrad to other curriculum initiatives, overview its key functionality, present results from an evaluation conducted during its first year of deployment, and discuss our lessons learned and future directions.

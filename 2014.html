 Three shifts for sustainable HCI: Scalable, sticky, and
  multidisciplinary.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

While there has been a steady increase in sustainable HCI research, there remains a lack of consensus on how to ensure this research moves us towards achieving sustainability. This paper suggests three ways the sustainable HCI community might shift to better address the challenge of achieving global sustainability. First, we should shift from creating only small-scale solutions to systems and solutions that are scalable to many users and environments because the problem of sustainability is vast in scale. Second, we should shift from short-term solutions to `sticky' solutions that will continue to have an impact over decades, because sustainability is a problem that will span generations. Third, the sustainable HCI community must shift from an insular focus on our community to a broad engagement and collaboration with other research communities involved in sustainability research.

 Enabling active participation in the Smart Grid through
  crowdsourced power quality data.
 Technical Report CSDL-14-01, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI,
  April 2014.
[&nbsp;<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2014/14-01/14-01.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">
This technical report presents a research project designed to gain insight into the following questions: Can crowdsourced power quality data enable active participation in the Smart Grid?  What are the technical, social, behavioral, and economic requirements for crowdsourced data that make it effective for detection, monitoring, prediction and diagnosis of selected Smart Grid power quality issues? And finally, how can these project outcomes improve &ldquo;citizen science&rdquo; in general and the kinds of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators needed for successful outcomes?

 Kukini: The challenges in the design, implementation, and evaluation
  of a digital records transfer tool for the Hawaii State Digital Archives.
 Master's thesis, University of Hawaii, April 2014.
[&nbsp;<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2014/14-02/14-02.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">

At the Hawaii State Archives, there is a need to update their digital records preservation capabilities. Thus, they are currently in the process of implementing a records
system which has been designed to store, protect, and preserve digital records. The
types of digital records include medical records, annual reports, birth records, etc.
This records system requires a Digital Records Transfer tool which must provide government agencies of Hawaii with the ability to transfer digital records to the Hawaii
State Archives. Its transfer process must use secure and authenticated methods that
document and ensure that the entirety of the les have been transferred uncorrupted.
Kukini is a digital records transfer tool that has been designed, implemented, tested,
and evaluated for use within an archival framework. This paper discusses the design,
implementation, and evaluation of Kukini.

 Simplifying sustainability game design: A usability evaluation of the
  Makahiki virtualmachine installation and the Smart Grid game designer.
 Master's thesis, University of Hawaii, April 2014.
[&nbsp;<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2014/14-03/14-03.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">

The usability of an application is a measure of how effectively it can be used to perform the tasks it was designed for in its target environment. A user interface – the toolbars, menus, and other elements that control an application – determines how quickly and correctly users can complete tasks. Makahiki is an application framework for designing serious games (games which teach a serious subject) focused on energy conservation, recycling, and clean energy issues. Two features were added to Makahiki in response to user feedback: support for a cross-platform installation method for virtual machines, and a simplified drag-and-drop graphical user interface called the Smart Grid Game Designer (SGG). Usability testing data and feedback on these new features was compared to data and feedback from the previous iteration of Makahiki to determine the effect of these features on the user experience. It was found that the virtual machine installation produced significant improvements in user experience and configuration time. However, users who tested the Smart Grid Game Designer reported issues in understanding Makahiki's "predicate system" of relationships between game tasks that were similar to issues reported by users of the previous iteration of Makahiki.

 OPQ Cloud: A scalable software framework for the aggregation of
  distributed power quality data.
 Technical Report CSDL-14-04, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI,
  April 2014.
[&nbsp;<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2014/14-04/14-04.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">
Power quality issues can be caused in a variety of situations. Voltage fluctuations, frequency fluctuations, and harmonics are all power quality issues which can be caused by weather, high penetration of renewables, man-made issues, or other natural phenomena. We designed a software framework which can aggregate crowdsourced distributed power quality measurements in order to study power quality issues over a dense geographic area.

 Grammarviz 2.0: A tool for grammar-based pattern discovery in time
  series.
 In <em>Proceedings of ECML PKDD 2014</em>, Nancy, France, September
  2014.
[&nbsp;<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2014/14-06/14-06.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">

The problem of frequent and anomalous patterns discovery in time series has received a lot of attention in the past decade. Addressing the common limitation of existing techniques, which require a pattern length to be known in advance, we recently proposed grammar-based algorithms for efficient discovery of variable length frequent and rare patterns. In this paper we present GrammarViz2.0, an interactive tool that, based on our previous work, implements algorithms for grammar-driven mining and visualization of variable length time series patterns.

 Makahiki: An open source serious game framework for sustainability
  education and conservation.
 In <em>Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on
  Sustainability, Technology, and Education</em>, Taipei City, Taiwan, December
  2014.
[&nbsp;<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2014/14-10/14-10.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">

Sustainability education and conservation have become an international imperative due to the rising cost of energy, increasing scarcity of natural resource and irresponsible environmental practices. This paper presents Makahiki, an open source serious game framework for sustainability, which implements an extensible framework for different organizations to develop sustainability games. It provides a variety of built-in games and content focused on sustainability; game mechanics such as leaderboards, points, and badges; a variety of common services such as authentication, real-time game analytics and ability to deploy to the cloud, as well as a responsive user interface for both computer and mobile devices. The successful implementation of six sustainability educational games in different organizations provides evidence regarding the ability to customize the Makahiki framework successfully to different environments.

 Design, implementation, and initial evaluation of OPQBox: A
  low-cost device for crowdsourced power quality monitoring.
 Technical Report CSDL-14-11, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI,

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The face of power distribution has changed rapidly over the last several decades. Modern grids are evolving to accommodate distributed power generation, and highly variable loads. Furthermore as the devices we use every day become more electronically complex, they become increasingly more sensitive to power quality problems. Distributed power quality monitoring systems have been shown to provide real-time insight on the status of the power grid and even pinpoint the origin of power disturbances. [6] Oahu’s isolated power grid combined with high penetration of distributed renewable energy generators create perfect conditions to assess the feasibility and utility of such a network. Over the last three months we have been collecting power quality data from several locations on Oahu as a pilot study for a larger monitoring system. This papers describes our methodology, hardware and software design and presents a preliminary analysis of the data we collected so far. Lastly this paper presents a design for an improved power quality monitor based upon the pilot study experiences.

In the past 10 years, there has been considerable evidence of the harmful effects of multitasking and other distractions on learning. One study found that multitasking students spend only 65 percent of their time actively learning, take longer to complete assignments, make more mistakes, are less able to remember material later, and show less ability to generalize the information they learned for use in other contexts.

Traditional software engineering education approaches: in-class lectures, unsupervised homework assignments, and occasional projects, create many opportunities for distraction. To address this problem, coauthor Philip M. Johnson developed an “athletic” software engineering education approach, which coauthors Emily Hill and Daniel Port adapted for use in their courses. We wanted to determine if software engineering education could be redesigned to be like an athletic endeavor and whether this would improve learning.

We present our findings after two years of experience involving three instructors using an “athletic” approach to software engineering education (AthSE). Co-author Johnson developed AthSE in 2013 to address issues he experienced teaching graduate and undergraduate software engineering. Co-authors Port and Hill subsequently adapted the original approach to their own software courses. AthSE is a pedagogy in which the course is organized into a series of skills to be mastered. For each skill, students are given practice "Workouts" along with videos showing the instructor performing the Workout both correctly and quickly. Unlike traditional homework assignments, students are advised to repeat the Workout not only until they can complete it correctly, but also as quickly as the instructor. In this experience report we investigate the following question: how can software engineering education be redesigned as an athletic endeavor, and will this provide more efficient and effective learning among students and more rapidly lead them to greater competency and confidence?

  abstract = {As power grids transition from a centralized distribution model to a distributed model, maintaining grid stability requires real-time power quality (PQ) monitoring and visualization. As part of the Open Power Quality (OPQ) project, we designed and deployed a set of open source power quality monitors and an open source cloud-based aggregation and visualization system built with the utility customer in mind. Our aim is to leverage a flexible privacy model combined with inexpensive and easy to use PQ meters in order to deploy a high density power quality monitoring network across the Hawaiian islands. In this paper we describe OPHub, a privacy focused open source PQ visualization along with results of a small scale deployment of our prototype PQ meter across the island of Oahu. Our results demonstrate that OPQ can provide useful power quality data at an order of magnitude less cost than prior approaches.

  abstract = {Sustainability education and conservation have become an international imperative due to the rising cost of energy, increasing scarcity of natural resource and irresponsible environmental practices. This paper presents Makahiki, an open source serious game framework for sustainability, which implements an extensible framework for different organizations to develop sustainability games. It provides a variety of built-in games and content focused on sustainability; game mechanics such as leaderboards, points, and badges; a variety of common services such as authentication, real-time game analytics and ability to deploy to the cloud, as well as a responsive user interface for both computer and mobile devices. The successful implementation of six sustainability educational games in different organizations provides evidence regarding the ability to customize the Makahiki framework successfully to different environments in both organizational and infrastructure aspects. A serious game stakeholder experience based access method (SGSEAM) was used to formally evaluate Makahiki in order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of Makahiki as a useful serious game framework for sustainability.

  abstract = {Static Observation Networks (SONs) are often used in the biological sciences to study animal migration and habitat. These networks are comprised of self-contained, stationary receivers that continuously listen for acoustic transmissions released by sonic tags carried by individual animals. The transmissions released by these tags carry serial identification numbers that can be used to verify that a particular individual was near a given receiver. Because receivers in these networks are stationary, receiver placement is critical to maximizing data recovery. Currently, no open-source automated mechanism exists to facilitate the design of optimal receiver networks. SON design is often governed by loose "rules of thumb" and "by eye" readings of low resolution bathymetric maps. Moreover, there is no standardized method for evaluating the efficacy of a SON. This paper introduces the Maximal Acoustic Network Designer (MANDe) a system which takes advantage of high-resolution bathymetric data and advanced animal modeling to provide optimal network designs. MANDe also allows for statistical analysis of existing network configurations in order to create efficacy-metrics that can be used to evaluate arbitrary network configurations. This paper will present MANDe’s mathematical and conceptual models and analyze the computational complexities of its methods. }

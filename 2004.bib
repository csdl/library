  An essential component of agile methods such as Extreme Programming is a
  suite of test cases that is incrementally built and maintained throughout
  development.  This paper presents research exploring two questions
  regarding testing in these agile contexts. First, is there a way to
  validate the quality of test case suites in a manner compatible with
  agile development methods?  Second, is there a way to assess and monitor
  the costs of agile test case development and maintenance?  In this paper,
  we present the results of our recent research on these issues. Our
  results include a measure called XC (for Extreme Coverage) which is
  implemented in a system called JBlanket. XC is designed to support
  validation of the test-driven design methodology used in agile
  development. We describe how XC and JBlanket differ from other coverage
  measures and tools, assess their feasibility through a case study in a
  classroom setting, assess its external validity on a set of open source
  systems, and illustrate how to incorporate XC into a more global measure
  of testing cost and quality called Unit Test Dynamics (UTD). We conclude
  with suggested research directions building upon these findings to
  improve agile methods and tools.

  Measurement definition, collection, and analysis is an essential
  component of high quality software engineering practice, and is thus an
  essential component of the software engineering curriculum.  However,
  providing students with practical experience with measurement in a
  classroom setting can be so time-consuming and intrusive that it's
  counter-productive---teaching students that software measurement is
  ``impractical'' for many software development contexts.  In this
  research, we designed and evaluated a very low-overhead approach to
  measurement collection and analysis using the Hackystat system with
  special features for classroom use. We deployed this system in two
  software engineering classes at the University of Hawaii during Fall,
  2003, and collected quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the
  effectiveness of the approach.  Results indicate that the approach
  represents substantial progress toward practical, automated metrics
  collection and analysis, though issues relating to the complexity of
  installation and privacy of user data remain.

One key to improving high-performance computing
(HPC) productivity is finding better ways to measure it.
We define productivity in terms of mission goals, i.e.,
greater productivity means that more science is
accomplished with less cost and effort. Traditional
software productivity metrics and computing benchmarks
have proven inadequate for assessing or predicting such
end-to-end productivity. In this paper we describe a new
approach to measuring productivity in HPC applications
that addresses both development time and execution time.
Our goal is to develop a public repository of effective
productivity benchmarks that anyone in the HPC
community can apply to assess or predict productivity.

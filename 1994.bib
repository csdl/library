  abstract = {Exploratory collaboration occurs in domains where the structure and process
of group work evolves as an intrinsic part of the collaborative activity.
Traditional database and hypertext structural models do not provide
explicit support for collaborative exploration.  EGRET is an implemented
environment for the development of domain-specific collaborative systems
that defines a novel data and a process model along with services for
exploratory collaboration.  To accomplish this, EGRET departs from
traditional notions of the relationship between schema and instance
structure.  In EGRET, schema structure is viewed as a representation of the
current state of consensus among collaborators, from which instance
structure is allowed to depart in a controlled fashion.  To provide such
exploratory services in a responsive interactive environment, EGRET
implements specialized architectural mechanisms. This paper presents the
concepts and implications of exploratory collaboration, followed by the
design and implementation of EGRET.  The paper concludes with our results
to date, which demonstrate that EGRET succeeds in providing useful services
for exploratory collaboration, through interesting technical and cultural
issues remain to be addressed before exploratory collaboration can become
commonplace in CSCW systems.}

  title = {{CLARE}: A Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Environment Based on the Thematic Structure of Scientific Text},
  year = 1994,
  type = {{Ph.D.} Thesis},
  keywords = {CLARE, Thesis-PhD},
  month = {May},
  abstract = {This dissertation presents a computer-based collaborative learning
environment, called CLARE, that is based on the theory of learning as
collaborative knowledge building. It addresses the question, "what can a
computer do for a group of learners beyond helping them share information?"

CLARE differs from virtual classrooms and hypermedia systems in three ways.
First, CLARE is grounded on the theory of meaningful learning, which
focuses the role of meta-knowledge in human learning.  Instead of merely
allowing learners to share information, CLARE provides an explicit
meta-cognitive framework, called RESRA, to help learners interpret
information and build knowledge. Second, CLARE defines a new group process,
called SECAI, that guides learners to systematically analyze, relate, and
discuss scientific text through a set of structured steps: summarization,
evaluation, comparison, argumentation, and integration.  Third, CLARE
provides a fine-grained, non-obtrusive instrumentation mechanism that
keeps track of the usage process of its users. Such data forms an important
source of feedback for enhancing the system and a basis for rigorously
studying collaboration learning behaviors of CLARE users.

CLARE was evaluated through sixteen usage sessions involving six groups of
students from two classes.  The experiments consist of a total of about 300
hours of usage and over 80,000 timestamps.  The survey shows that about 70%
of learners think that CLARE provides a novel way of understanding
scientific text, and about 80% of learners think that CLARE provides a
novel way of understanding their peers' perspectives.  The analysis of the
CLARE database and the process data also reveals that learners differ
greatly in theirinterpretations of RESRA, strategies for comprehending the
online text, and understanding of the selected artifact. It also found
that, despite the large amount of time spent on summarization, up to 66% of
these learners often fail to correctly represent important features of
scientific text and the relationships between those features.  Implications
of these findings at the design, empirical, and pedagogical levels are
discussed.},

  abstract = {Formal technical review (FTR) is an essential component of all
   modern software quality assessment, assurance, and improvement techniques,
   and is acknowledged to be the most cost-effective form of quality
   improvement when practiced effectively.  However, traditional FTR
   methods such as inspection are very difficult to adopt
   in organizations: they introduce substantial new up-front
   costs, training, overhead, and group process obstacles.  Sustained
   commitment from high-level management along with substantial
   resources is often necessary for successful technology transfer of
   FTR.

   Since 1991, we have been designing and evaluating a series of
   versions of a system called CSRS: an instrumented, computer-supported
   cooperative work environment for formal technical review.  The
   current version of CSRS includes an FTR method definition language,
   which allows organizations to design their own FTR method, and to
   evolve it over time. This paper describes how our approach to
   computer supported FTR can address some of the issues in technology
   transfer of FTR.},

  abstract = {The importance and benefits of formal technical review (FTR) as a
method to improve software quality have
been well documented, and yet there is a proliferation of the methods in
practice with varying degrees of success. Worse, the same methods are
often practiced inconsistently and the contribution of various review
factors on review outcomes is also not currently understood.

This research proposes a new approach to assess and study the
cost-effectiveness of various review factors. Our basic approach is to
first develop a framework that allows one to classify the similarities
and differences of existing FTR methods from the perspective of their
review processes.
Specifically, the framework looks into important review factors that
characterize a review process, such as the objective of a particular
phase within the review process, the interaction mode among review
participants and the technique being used during the phase.

Second, we will
develop a computer assisted review system, namely, CSRS version 3.0,
that can be used as an experimental testbed for empirically evaluating
different FTR factors that may impact the methods.
Finally, we will design a control experiment to answer an important
initial question concerning the cost-effectiveness of three different
examination techniques commonly used in existing FTR methods: free
review technique, selective test cases technique and stepwise
verification technique.},

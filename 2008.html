<blockquote><font size="-1">

The Personal Environmental Tracker (PET) is a proposed
system for helping people to track their impact on the
environment, and to make changes to reduce that impact,
creating a personal feedback loop. PET consists of sensors
that collect data such as home electricity or gasoline usage
and send it to a database for analysis and presentation to the
user. By collecting data from diverse sources, PET can help
users decide what aspect of their lives they should make
changes in first to maximize their reduction in
environmental impact. PET's open architecture will allow
other ubiquitous sustainability researchers to leverage the
infrastructure for research in sensors, data analysis, or
presentation of data.

Alexey Olkov and Daniel Port.
 Using simulation to investigate IT micro-processes.
 Technical Report CSDL-08-05, Department of Information and Computer
  Sciences, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, December 2008.
[&nbsp;<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2008/08-05/08-05.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">
This technical report describes how simulation can be used to (1) gain confidence
in empirical analysis of software micro-processes and (2) provide a means to validate or obtain
evidence to support software engineering hypotheses and theory.

  Searching the archives of electronic product support mailing lists often
  provides unsatisfactory results for users looking for quick solutions to
  their problems. Archives are inconvenient because they are too voluminous,
  lack efficient searching mechanisms, and retain the original thread structure
  which is not relevant to knowledge seekers.

  I present MCS, a system which improves mailing list archives through {\em
    condensation}. Condensation involves omitting redundant or useless
  messages, and adding meta-level information to messages to improve searching.
  The condensation process is performed by a human assisted by an editing tool.

  I describe the design and implementation of MCS, and compare it to related
  systems. I also present my experiences condensing a 1428 message mailing list
  archive to an archive containing only 177 messages (an 88\% reduction). The
  condensation required only 1.5 minutes of editor effort per message. The
  condensed archive was adopted by the users of the mailing list.

  abstract = {
Developers often use electronic mailing lists when seeking assistance with a
particular software application. The archives of these mailing lists provide a
rich repository of problem-solving knowledge. Developers seeking a quick answer
to a problem find these archives inconvenient, because they lack efficient
searching mechanisms, and retain the structure of the original conversational
threads which are rarely relevant to the knowledge seeker.

We present a system called MCS which improves mailing list archives through a
process called {\em condensation}. Condensation involves several tasks:
extracting only messages of longer-term relevance, adding metadata to those
messages to improve searching, and potentially editing the content of the
messages when appropriate to clarify. The condensation process is performed by
a human editor (assisted by a tool), rather than by an artificial intelligence
(AI) system.

We describe the design and implementation of MCS, and compare it to related
systems. We also present our experiences condensing a 1428 message mailing list
archive to an archive containing only 177 messages (an 88\% reduction). The
condensation required only 1.5 minutes of editor effort per message. The
condensed archive was adopted by the users of the mailing list.

  Software developers work too hard and yet do not get enough done.
  Developing high quality software efficiently and consistently is a very
  difficult problem.  Developers and managers have tried many different
  solutions to address this problem.  Recently their focus has shifted from
  the software organization to the individual software developer.  For
  example, the Personal Software Process incorporates many of the previous
  solutions while focusing on the individual software developer.

  This thesis presents the Leap toolkit, which combines ideas from prior
  research on the Personal Software Process, Formal Technical Review and my
  experiences building automated support for software engineering activities.
  The Leap toolkit is intended to help individuals in their efforts to improve
  their development capabilities.  Since it is a light-weight, flexible,
  powerful, and private tool, it provides a novel way for developers to gain
  valuable insight into their own development process. The Leap toolkit also
  addresses many measurement and data issues involved with recording any
  software development process.

  The main thesis of this work is that the Leap toolkit provides a novel
  tool that allows developers and researchers to collect and analyze
  software engineering data.  To investigate some of the issues of data
  collection and analysis, I conducted a case study of 16 graduate students
  in an advanced software engineering course at the University of Hawaii,
  Manoa.  The case study investigated: (1) the relationship between the
  Leap toolkit's time collection tools and ``collection stage'' errors; and
  (2) different time estimation techniques supported by the Leap toolkit.

  The major contributions of this research includes (1) the LEAP design
  philosophy; (2) the Leap toolkit, which is a novel tool for individual
  developer improvement and software engineering research; and (3) the insights
  from the case study about collection overhead, collection error and project
  estimation.}

This paper presents our experiences using the Leap toolkit, an automated tool
to support personal developer improvement.  The Leap toolkit incorporates ideas
from the PSP and group review.  It relaxes some of the constraints in the PSP
and reduces process overhead.  Our lessons learned include: (1)
Collecting data about software development is useful; (2) Leap enables users to accurately estimate size and time
  in a known domain; (3) Many users feel their programming skills improve
  primarily due to practice, not their method; (4) To reduce measurement dysfunction, make the results less visible; (5) Partial defect collection and analysis is still useful; (6) Tool support should require few machine resources; and (7)
Experience may lead to overconfidence.

  summary = {
For several years, we have pursued an initiative called Project LEAP, whose
goal is the improvement of individual developers though lightweight,
empirical, anti-measurement dysfunction, and portable software engineering
tools and methods.
During the Fall of 1999, we performed a case study using the LEAP toolkit
in a graduate software engineering class.  One of the goals of the study
was to evaluate the various analytical estimation methods made available by
the toolkit.  We were curious as to whether a single method would prove
most accurate, or whether the most accurate method would depend upon the
type of project or the specific developer.  To our surprise, we found that,
in most cases, the developer-generated ``guesstimates'' were more accurate
than the analytical estimates.
We also found that the PROBE method of the
Personal Software Process, perhaps the most widely
publicized analytical approach to personal effort estimation, was the sixth
most accurate method.  Finally, we found that access to a range of
analytical estimation methods appeared to be useful to developers in
generating their guesstimates and improving them over time. }

Development of Open Source Software is in many cases a collaborative
effort, often by geographically dispersed team members.  The problem for
members is to efficiently review documentation and source code and to
collect and share comments and annotations that will lead to improvements
in performance, functionality, and quality.  javaJAM is a collaborative
tool for assisting with the development of Open Source Software.  It
generates integrated documentation and source code presentations to be
viewed over the web.  More importantly, javaJAM provides an interactive
environment for navigating documentation and source code and for posting
annotations.  javaJAM creates relationships between sections of
documentation, source, and related comments and annotations to provide the
necessary cross-referencing to support quick and efficient reviews.
javaJAM was evaluated in a classroom setting.  Student teams posted
projects for team review using javaJAM and found it to be an easy way to
review their projects and post their comments.

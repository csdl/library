  year = 1991,
  summary = {The EGRET Project at the University of Hawaii is pursuing a research
program designed to investigate evolution in collaborative systems.
Evolution is of central concern due to the exploratory nature of many
CSCW application areas, including software development, document
preparation, issue generation and discussion, and so forth.  In
exploratory domains, the ill-defined or changing nature of both the
problem and an acceptable solution to it impose special demands.  For
example, the criteria for an acceptable solution, or the solution
generation method may be an an emergent property of the exploratory
process.  This paper discusses our research paradigm and initial progress.}

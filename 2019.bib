  abstract = {Capturing and classifying power quality phenomena is important for the smooth functioning of electrical grids.  This paper presents methods for classifying the four types of transients (impulsive, arcing, oscillatory, and periodic notching) specified in the IEEE 1159 Power Quality standard. Our methods implement a tractable algorithm, which applies well understood signal processing methods and statistical inference for feature extraction and decision making. We tested our methods on simulated power quality disturbances in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. The results of this research include an operational implementation of a transient classifier for Open Power Quality, an open source distributed power quality network. Additional functionality can be easily incorporated into the system to extend the utility of our methods, such as a meta-analysis to capture higher level network wide events.

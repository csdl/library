server system and the ECS client system, together known as Egret. HBS is a
multiuser, database server for (non-video) hypermedia applications.  It
manages storage, locking, retrieval, and inter-client communications.
This document is intended to describe the interface between
HBS and ECS in enough detail so that alternative database servers can be
built to service requests from an ECS clients. It is also intended to serve as a source
of reference material for maintainers of the HBS and ECS systems.},

  seminar on collaborative systems at the University of Hawaii during
  Fall, 1994.  AEN was used for over 285 hours during the second half of
  the semester alone, and users generated over 800 nodes and 800 links.
  Lessons learned about strong collaboration include: (1) Users as well
  as artifacts should be visible; (2) Provide direct and indirect
  authoring mechanisms; (3) Provide context-sensitive change information;
  (4) Provide access to intermediate work products; (5) Maintain database
  integrity; (6) The WWW is not effective for strong collaboration; and
  (7) An agent-based architecture may be necessary for systems supporting
  strong collaboration.},

variations of the method in practice, especially those related to the
group process.  This paper discusses a new approach to how
organizations can build their own review systems that are most
suitable to them.  Our basic approach is to use CSRS modeling
languages to characterize the review method descriptively.  The
language descriptions are then compiled to generate the corresponding
review systems.  CSRS modeling languages are developed based on FTR
framework which models both variations in the group process
and review strategies exhibited by current FTR methods.},

weaknesses of a computer-based approach to improving the sense of community
within one organization, the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at
the University of Hawaii.  The case study used a pretest-posttest design.
First, several measures of the sense of community within the department were
obtained via a questionnaire.  Second, a World Wide Web information system was
introduced in an effort to affect the level of community within the department.
Third, a similar questionnaire was administered after a period of four months.
Analysis of the survey responses and system logs showed that the information
system designed to promote community in this organization had instead polarized
it.  However, these systems can also serve as a diagnostic tool for discovering
what factors may help promote or inhibit community building.}

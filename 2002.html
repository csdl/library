<blockquote><font size="-1">

The ICS department of the University of Hawaii has faced problems
surrounding approval code distribution as its enrollment has increased. The
manual system for approval code allocation was time-consuming, ineffective
and inefficient. INCA is designed to automate the task of approval code
allocation, improve the quality of course approval decisions, and decrease
the administrative overhead involved in those decisions.

Based upon informal feedback from department administrators, it appears
that INCA reduces their overhead and makes their life easier. What are the
old problems that are solved by INCA? Does INCA introduce new kinds of
problems for the administrator? What about the students? Are they
completely satisfied with the system? In what ways does the system benefit
the department as a whole?

This thesis discusses the design, implementation and evaluation of INCA. It
evaluates INCA from the viewpoint of the administrator, the students, and
the department. An analysis of emails received at uhmics@hawaii.edu account
indicates that INCA reduces administrative overhead. The results of the
user survey show that three quarters of students believe INCA improved
their course approval predictability and course requirements
understandability. They prefer INCA to old method of requesting approval
codes by email. INCA database analysis provided course demand information
and student statistics useful for departments. This evaluation of INCA from
three different perspectives provides useful insights for future
improvement of INCA and for improving the student experience with academic
systems in general.

 Bringing the faulkes telescope to classrooms in hawaii.
 M.S. Thesis Proposal CSDL-02-01, Department of Information and
  Computer Sciences, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, March 2002.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

The Faulkes Telescope (FT), currently under construction on the summit of
Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii, will provide data from celestial observations to
schools in the United Kingdom and Hawaii. This project, with its unique
goal of building a telescope to be used exclusively for educational
purposes, is a joint venture between groups in the United Kingdom and
Hawaii. Teachers and students will be able to download data that has been
collected by the telescope on a previous occasion or sign up to have the
telescope collect data at a specific time for them. Current plans call for
data from the telescope to be delivered to classrooms in the form of raw
data files and images from processed raw data files. In addition to sharing
use of the telescope, part of the agreement between the UK and Hawaii
groups provides for the UK group to share all software developed for the
project with the Hawaii group. However, though a system for transporting
images to schools is being developed for the UK side, at present there is
no corresponding system for Hawaii. Also, at this point neither the British
nor Hawaii sides have a definite system for storing and transporting raw
data files.

A first step, therefore, toward making the FT useful
for students and teachers in Hawaii is to develop a plan for a complete
system to archive and transport telescope data. It is anticipated that a
plan for this system will include: 1) a specification of the required
hardware components, 2) a description of how data will move in and out of
the system, 3) a definition of the data pathway within the system, and 4) a
description of the data storage requirements (i.e. database). The
development of each of the components of the system will consist of a
discussion of available options followed by a suggestion of the best choice
of action. Development of this system is anticipated to be the topic for a
directed reading/research project to be undertaken during spring,
2002. After the system has been clearly defined there are some additional
questions to be answered. Among the more interesting aspects is the
question of how to present data from the telescope in the most useful and
effective manner to teachers and students.

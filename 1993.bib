  abstract = {Formal technical review (FTR) is a cornerstone of software quality
assurance.  However, the labor intensive and manual nature of review, along
with basic unresolved questions about its process and products, means that
review is typically under-utilized or inefficiently applied within the
software development process. This paper introduces CSRS, a
computer-supported cooperative work environment for software review that
improves the efficiency of review activities and supports empirical
investigation of the appropriate parameters for review. The paper presents
a typical scenario of CSRS in review, its data and process model,
application to process maturation, relationship to other research, current
status, and future directions.},

  abstract = {This research concerns the representation issue in collaborative learning
environments. Our basic claim is that knowledge representation is not only
fundamental to machine learning, as shown by AI researchers, but also
essential to human learning, in particular, human metalearning.  Few
existing learning support systems, however, provide representations which
help the learner make sense of and organize the subject content of
learning, integrate a wide range of classroom activities, (e.g., reading,
reviewing, writing, discussion), and compare and contrast various
viewpoints from individual learners.  It is our primary purpose to
construct an example instance of such a representation, and to show that
useful computational manipulations can be performed on it, and that the
combination of the representation and related computational services can
actually lead to the improved learner's performance on selected
collaborative learning tasks.},

  summary = {This paper concerns collaborative learning as an active knowledge
construction processes. It asserts an essential role of knowledge
representation in achieving a high-level collaborative support. Our central
claim is that the presence of an expressive and usable representation,
combined with necessary computational support, can significantly enhance
the learners' performance in understanding the subject content of learning
artifacts, integrating various classroom activities, and relating different
viewpoints held by other learners. First, we propose a representational
framework, called RESRA, which characterizes the thematic structure of
learning and research artifacts. We then develop a computer-based tool,
called CLARE, that facilitates the use of RESRA for various collaborative
learning tasks, such as evaluating existing work (e.g., papers, programs,
design) or constructing new work. We also design a set of experiments which
will allow us to empirically assess the effectiveness of CLARE and our
research claims.},

This paper introduces a review system called CSRS (Collaborative Software
Review System) that allows one to
experiment with  various aspects of review process, to compare
different review methods,  and at the same
time to use it as practical tools for supporting review activities.
The system also allows the user's organization to analyze and
to improve their review process based upon metrics data collected by
the system automatically.}

  summary = {During the development of software projects, there
          always exists the problem of design specification
          maintenance.  As the project team surges ahead
          with the development process, there is a strong
          need to maintain an up-to-date documentation of
          the current system.  This requires an additional
          effort on each team member to maintain a
          consistent report of the modifications and
          additions they make on the system.

This Designbase project attempts to reduce the overhead involved in
the maintenance of ever changing design specifications, by generating
automatically, a design documentation from the source code and the
overview files that are maintained along with the system.},

to show the motivation behind the project as well as describing the

The URN project is an Egret application that implements a new paradigm for
utilizing the massive, ever-changing data stream that is Usenet.  The
acronym URN stands for Ultimate Read News, but it can also be thought of
more symbolically as a repository for knowledge. The goal of URN is to
make the information available through Usenet more useful by using different
perspectives on Usenet and new ways to extract useful data from Usenet.
This paper describes problems with USENET, the way URN is intended to
		  address
these problems, and the current status and future directions of the

breadth and depth of information captured per person-hour of review time,
and that its design captures interesting measures of review process,
products, and effort.}

  title = {Improving Software Quality through Formal Technical Review: A Research Agenda},
  year = 1993,
  summary = {Formal technical review (FTR) encompasses a range of structured,
collaborative methods employing technical personnel to improve the quality
of a software development artifact.  Research shows that FTR, when
appropriately practiced, provides significant benefits. However, research
also shows that FTR introduces substantial new overhead, and that its
cost-effectiveness is easily compromised by a variety of group process
obstacles.  In addition, current FTR practice is difficult and costly to
investigate effectively, and thus many important questions about its nature
and comparative effectiveness remain unanswered.

This document presents a research agenda intended to address problems in
both the practice and research of FTR through CSRS (Collaborative
Software Review System), an instrumented, computer-supported cooperative
work environment. CSRS provides automated support for many time consuming
aspects of FTR, avoids many group process problems inherent in traditional,
manual review, and captures unique, high quality empirical data about the
process and products of FTR.

The research agenda includes:
(1) Controlled experimental laboratory studies on automated FTR support.
(2) Technology transfer of CSRS to selected industrial sites.
(3) Development of a domain-specific version of CSRS for C++ software.
(4) Creation of a CSRS consortium for collaborative FTR research between
    industry and academia.},

well documented, and yet there is a proliferation of methods in

This paper discusses a new approach to assess and study various

Our basic approach is to use a computer assisted review system (CSRS)
equipped with mechanisms to model different review methods and
at the same time capture fine-grained measurements
about the product and the process of the review.
Through suitable experimental design, these data can be used to
compare the different methods to each other.},

  abstract = {Exploratory collaboration occurs in domains where the structure and process
of group work evolves as an intrinsic part of the collaborative activity.
Traditional database and hypertext structural models do not provide
explicit support for collaborative exploration.  The EGRET framework
defines both a data and a process model along with supporting analysis
techniques that provide novel support for exploratory collaboration.  To do
so, the EGRET framework breaks with traditional notions of the relationship
between schema and instance structure.  In EGRET, schema structure is
viewed as a representation of the current state of consensus among
collaborators, from which instance structure is allowed to depart in a
controlled fashion.  This paper discusses the issues of exploratory
collaboration, the EGRET approach to its support, and the current status of
this research.}

  keywords = {CLARE, Publications-Workshops},
  abstract = {Scientific learning and research are becoming increasingly
  computerized. More and more such activities are mediated through
  electronic artifacts. This paper presents an artifact-based system
  called COREVIEW, to be used in the domain of research seminars. The
  emphasis of our approach is on the centrality of textualized artifacts
  in seminar activities, the relationship between different types of
  artifacts, and the dynamic interactions among them over time. Our
  system provides explicit representation of research artifacts and their
  structures, and support for the process of collaborative artifact
  generation, integration, manipulation and utilization.},

  title = {Collaborative Software Review for Capturing Design Rationale},
  keywords = {CSRS, Publications-Workshops},
  year = 1992,
  summary = {This paper discusses connections between
collaborative software review and design rationale.  Not
surprisingly, collaborative software review activities provide an
excellent source of design rationale information, since analysis of
artifacts under review often involves design justifications and
alternatives.  Also, software reviews form an interesting point
at which to take a discrete ``snapshot'' in the historical record of
design, since they tend to take place only when the software is in a
relatively consistent and coherent state.  Finally, an exploratory
focus upon collaborative software review leads to a interesting variation on concurrent orientations
toward design and implementation.},

  year = 1992,
  month = {May},
  summary = {Research literature is not merely a formal vehicle for disseminating the
results of scientific research; it is also an important learning resource
for advanced learners (e.g., graduate students) and beginning researchers.
The purpose of this research is to investigate the structural and
process-level characteristics of research review as a collaborative
activity, and to develop computational mechanisms to facilitate such a
process. This paper briefly summarizes our ongoing efforts of developing a
software environment, called COREVIEW, for supporting collaborative
research review.}

The world is in the grip of a crisis in the way energy is produced and consumed. Climate change represents a huge threat to the modern way of life, particularly for island communities like Hawaii. Many changes to our energy system will be required to resolve the crisis, and one promising part of the solution is reducing energy usage through changes in behavior. Energy usage in similar homes can differ by a factor of two to four times, demonstrating the potential contribution of behavior change to the crisis.

This research project seeks to find ways to foster sustainable changes in behavior that lead to reduced energy usage. The research will be conducted in the context of a dorm energy competition on the UH Manoa campus in October 2010. Power meters will be installed on each floor of two freshmen residence halls. Each floor will compete to use the least energy during the 4 week competition.

A competition website will be created, where participants can log in to view near-realtime data about their floor's power usage, and also select from a variety of tasks to perform. Each task is designed to increase the participant's energy literacy (knowledge, positive attitudes, and behaviors related to energy), and a certain number of points are assigned for the completion of each task. The points provide a parallel competition to motivate participants to perform the tasks. Prizes will be awarded to floors using the least energy, and participants obtaining the most points.

Several research questions will be investigated using the data collected, including how energy usage changed after the competition is over, whether the website tasks affected energy literacy, and whether floors that had higher energy literacy had more sustained energy conservation after the competition was complete. The research questions will be investigated using energy data from the meters, log files from the website, and an energy literacy survey administered before and after the competition.

Kukui nut oil was used by ancient Hawaiians to light their homes.  In honor
of this original form of energy in the islands, we propose to design and
implement a Dorm Energy Competition for the University of Hawaii called the
``Kukui Cup''.   It will be held for the first time during the month of October,
2011.  The three goals of this project are: (1) Improve the energy literacy
of participating students; (2) Conduct innovative research in information
technology for energy-related behavioral change; and (3) Save money for the
university by reducing energy costs.  As part of this project, we will
implement a new web application to provide information regarding UH Dorm
Energy in general and the Kukui Cup competition in particular.  This
software will also support research on energy behavior by the Collaborative
Software Development Laboratory in the Department of Information and
Computer Sciences.  We propose to hold the October, 2011 dorm energy
competition in three freshman dorms, and then expand the program to include
more dorms in future years.

Because of our ever-increasing population and our limited natural resources, improving the energy literacy of the population is becoming increasingly important.  A way to promote these habits is to hold energy competitions to see who can reduce their energy usage the most.  A popular place to hold these competitions are in University dorms, where students are making the transition from living with their parents to living on their own.  Holding these competitions are a great way to educate the student population, but the development of the competition can be costly.  Besides prizes for the winning individuals/dorms, creating and maintaining a development website can take a lot of time.  Some groups have turned to software development firms that provide the software and hardware, but at a cost.

We propose a system called Makahiki that will provide a free, open-source, and easy to implement solution.  Using other open source tools such as WattDepot, we aim to create a configurable package for organizations who hope to hold their own energy competitions.  To test our implementation, we will be holding a dorm energy competition here at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in October 2011.  We will also test the configurability of our system by implementing another organization's dorm energy competition website.

  WattDepot is an open source, Internet-based, service-oriented framework
  for collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of energy data.
  WattDepot differs from other energy management solutions in one or more
  of the following ways: it is not tied to any specific metering
  technology; it provides high-level support for meter aggregation and data
  interpolation; it supports carbon intensity analysis; it is
  architecturally decoupled from the underlying storage technology; it
  supports both hosted and local energy services; it can provide near-real
  time data collection and feedback; and the software is open source and
  freely available.  In this paper, we introduce the framework, provide
  examples of its use, and discuss its application to research and
  understanding of the Smart Grid.

Enterprise-scale energy data collection and analysis is becoming increasingly important with the advent of the "Smart" grid. We have developed and released an open source, sensor-based system called WattDepot for collecting, storing and analyzing energy data to fill this niche that is greater than individual households but less than entire utility grids. WattDepot is designed to allow data collection from a wide variety of energy production and consumption devices, and to support diverse visualizations and delivery of the data. We are using WattDepot to support a campus dormitory energy competition for Fall 2010. Since the process of selecting, purchasing, and installing the meters is ongoing, we have developed an end-to-end simulation of dorm energy to ensure that the WattDepot software sensors would work with any of the chosen meters. WattDepot's sensor-based, service-oriented architecture makes it useful to a wide variety of energy application domains.

A process defines a set of routines which allow one to organize, manage and improve activities in order to reach a goal. With expert intuition and a-priori knowledge, software processes have been modeled for a long time, resulting in the Waterfall, Spiral and other development models. Later, with the wide use of SCM systems and the public availability of primitive software process artifact trails, formal methods such as Petri Nets, State Machines and others have been applied to the problem of recurrent process discovery and control. Recent advances in metrics effort, increased use of continuous integration, and extensive documentation of the performed process make information-rich fine-grained software process artifacts trails available for analysis. This fine-grained data has the potential to shed new light on the software process. In this work I propose to investigate an automated technique for the discovery and characterization of recurrent behaviors in software development - "programming habits" either on an individual or a team level.

The current U.S. electrical power grid is an out-of-date
infrastructure, and the Smart Grid is an upgrade that
will add many new functionalities to meet customers' new
power requirements. Updating a system as complex as the
electrical power grid has the potential of introducing
new security vulnerabilities into the system. This
document presents a review of the work related to Smart
Grid cyber security. The work reviewed is separated into
five categories that make up different components of the
Smart Grid: Process Control System (PCS) Security, Smart
Meter Security, Power System State Estimation Security,
Smart Grid Communication Protocol Security, and Smart
Grid Simulation for Security Analysis. The Smart Grid is
a large complex system, and it still requires a lot of
cyber security design work.  }

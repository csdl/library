 HBS interface specification.

This document specifies the interface protocol observed between the HBS
server system and the ECS client system, together known as Egret. HBS is a
multiuser, database server for (non-video) hypermedia applications.  It
manages storage, locking, retrieval, and inter-client communications.
This document is intended to describe the interface between
HBS and ECS in enough detail so that alternative database servers can be
built to service requests from an ECS clients. It is also intended to serve as a source
of reference material for maintainers of the HBS and ECS systems.

 Investigating strong collaboration with the Annotated Egret
  Navigator.
 In <em>Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE Workshop on Enabling
  Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises (WET-ICE '95)</em>,
  April 1995.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The Annotated Egret Navigator (AEN) is a system designed to support
  strong collaboration among a group as they cooperatively build,
  review, revise, and improve a structured hypertext document.  AEN was
  used as the central instructional and research system for a graduate
  seminar on collaborative systems at the University of Hawaii during
  Fall, 1994.  AEN was used for over 285 hours during the second half of
  the semester alone, and users generated over 800 nodes and 800 links.
  Lessons learned about strong collaboration include: (1) Users as well
  as artifacts should be visible; (2) Provide direct and indirect
  authoring mechanisms; (3) Provide context-sensitive change information;
  (4) Provide access to intermediate work products; (5) Maintain database
  integrity; (6) The WWW is not effective for strong collaboration; and
  (7) An agent-based architecture may be necessary for systems supporting
  strong collaboration.

HBS is an 11 KLOC Hypertext Multiuser Database Server written in
  C++. HBS is designed to work with ECS clients, as part of the Egret
  client-server system.  HBS is broken down into four blocks, File
  Operations, Basic Hypertext Operations, Events and Locks, and
  Client/Server Operations.  There is also a built in debugging mechanism
  and memory leak detection system.  This document describes the internal

 Supporting authoring and learning in a strongly collaborative

<blockquote><font size="-1">
With the increased use of hypertext, the issues behind collaborative
authoring of hypertext are becoming more important.  This thesis presents
the Annotated Egret Navigator (AEN), a system designed to support
strong collaboration among a group as they cooperatively build, review,
revise, improve and learn from a structured hypertext document.  AEN
addresses how strong collaboration can be supported through computer
mediation.  It is designed to support collaborative creation of hypertext
and to instrument the actions of its users in order to understand how such
creation occurs.

 Building software review systems using CSRS.
 Technical Report CSDL-95-06, Department of Information and Computer
  Sciences, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, January 1995.
[&nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.ics.hawaii.edu/pub/tr/ics-tr-95-06.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">
The importance of Software Review or Formal Technical Review (FTR) and
its benefits have been well documented. However, there are many
variations of the method in practice, especially those related to the
group process.  This paper discusses a new approach to how
organizations can build their own review systems that are most
suitable to them.  Our basic approach is to use CSRS modeling
languages to characterize the review method descriptively.  The
language descriptions are then compiled to generate the corresponding
review systems.  CSRS modeling languages are developed based on FTR
framework which models both variations in the group process
and review strategies exhibited by current FTR methods.

This document describes a pilot experiment that compares the cost
  effectiveness of a group-based review method (EGSM) to that of an
  individual-based review method (EIAM) using CSRS. In this pilot study, no

  found. This document provides complete details on the procedures and

 Building community through the world wide web.
 M.S. Thesis CSDL-95-11, Department of Information and Computer
  Sciences, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, July 1995.
[&nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.ics.hawaii.edu/pub/tr/ics-tr-95-11.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">
This thesis presents a case study designed to assess the strengths and
weaknesses of a computer-based approach to improving the sense of community
within one organization, the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at
the University of Hawaii.  The case study used a pretest-posttest design.
First, several measures of the sense of community within the department were
obtained via a questionnaire.  Second, a World Wide Web information system was
introduced in an effort to affect the level of community within the department.
Third, a similar questionnaire was administered after a period of four months.
Analysis of the survey responses and system logs showed that the information
system designed to promote community in this organization had instead polarized
it.  However, these systems can also serve as a diagnostic tool for discovering
what factors may help promote or inhibit community building.

 Beyond the personal software process: Metrics collection and analysis
  for the differently disciplined.
 In <em>Proceedings of the 2003 International Conference on Software
  Engineering</em>, Portland, Oregon, May 2003.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

  Pedagogies such as the Personal Software Process (PSP)
  shift metrics definition, collection, and analysis from
  the organizational level to the individual level.  While
  case study research indicates that the PSP can provide
  software engineering students with empirical support for
  improving estimation and quality assurance, there is
  little evidence that many students continue to use the PSP
  when no longer required to do so.  Our research suggests
  that this &ldquo;PSP adoption problem&rdquo; may be due to two
  problems: the high overhead of PSP-style metrics
  collection and analysis, and the requirement that PSP
  users &ldquo;context switch&rdquo; between product development and
  process recording.  This paper overviews our initial PSP
  experiences, our first attempt to solve the PSP adoption
  problem with the LEAP system, and our current approach
  called Hackystat.  This approach fully automates both data
  collection and analysis, which eliminates overhead and
  context switching. However, Hackystat changes the kind of
  metrics data that is collected, and introduces new
  privacy-related adoption issues of its own.

 Improving software quality through extreme coverage with JBlanket.
 M.S. Thesis CSDL-02-06, Department of Information and Computer
  Sciences, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, May 2003.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

Unit testing is an important part of software testing that aids in the
discovery of bugs sooner in the software development process.  Extreme
Programming (XP), and its Test First Design technique, relies so heavily upon
unit tests that the first code implemented is made up entirely of
test cases.  Furthermore, XP considers a feature to be completely coded
only when all of its test cases pass.  However, passing all test cases does
not necessarily mean the test cases are good.
&lt;p&gt;
Extreme Coverage (XC) is a new approach that helps to assess and improve the
quality of software by enhancing unit testing.  It extends the XP requirement
that all test cases must pass with the requirement that all defect-prone
testable methods must be invoked by the tests.  Furthermore, a set of flexible
rules are applied to XC to make it as attractive and light-weight as unit
testing is in XP.  One example rule is to exclude all methods containing one
line of code from analysis.  I designed and implemented a new tool, called
JBlanket, that automates the XC measurement process similar to the way that
JUnit automates unit testing.  JBlanket produces HTML reports similar to JUnit
reports which inform the user about which methods need to be tested next.
&lt;p&gt;
In this research, I explore the feasibility of JBlanket, the amount of effort
needed to reach and maintain XC, and the impact that knowledge of XC has on
system implementation through deployment and evaluation in an academic
environment.  Results show that most students find JBlanket to be a useful tool
in developing their test cases, and that knowledge of XC did influence the
manner in which students implemented their systems. However,  more studies are
needed to conclude precisely how much effort is needed to reach and maintain
XC.
&lt;p&gt;
This research lays the foundation for future research directions.  One
direction involves increasing its flexibility and value by expanding and
refining the rules of XC.  Another direction involves tracking XC behavior to
find out when it is and is not applicable.

 The design, implementation, and evaluation of CLEW: An improved
  collegiate department website.
 B.S. Thesis CSDL-03-03, Department of Information and Computer
  Sciences, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, May 2003.
[&nbsp;<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2003/03-03/03-03.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">

The purpose of a collegiate department website is to provide prospective
students, current students, faculty, staff, and other academic and industry
professionals with information concerning the department.  The information
presented on the website should give the user an accurate model of the
department, even as it changes overtime.  Some of these changes include:
adding new faculty members, new students, new courses, etc.  The more
accurately the website models the department, the more aware the website's
users will be of the department.

Traditional collegiate department websites have two primary problems in
creating an accurate model of their department.  First, only a few people,
usually the department webmasters, can add information to the website.
Second, it is difficult to enable website users to be informed of changes
to the website that might be of interest to them.  These two problems
decrease the accuracy of the model and hamper its effectiveness in alerting
users of changes to the website.  As a result, user awareness of the
department is also decreased.

The Collaborative Educational Website (CLEW) is a Java web application
intended to support accurate modeling of a collegiate department.  CLEW is
designed to solve the traditional collegiate department website's two main
problems.  First, it provides interactive services which will allow users
to add various kinds of information to the website.  Secondly, CLEW
addresses the notification problem by providing tailored email
notifications of changes to the website.

CLEW was developed by a Software Engineering class in the Information and
Computer Science Department at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
My role in this development as project leader is to design and
implement the framework for the system.  CLEW currently contains
approximately 28,000 lines of Java code and it contains upwards of
500 web pages.  In the Spring 2003 semester, CLEW replaced the
existing Information and Computer Science Department website.  I
evaluated CLEW to measure its effectiveness as a model of the
department using a pre and post release questionnaire.  I also
evaluated usage data of the CLEW System to assess the functionality
provided by CLEW.

If CLEW provides a more accurate model of a collegiate department,
then the next step is to provide the CLEW framework to other
collegiate departments worldwide.  It is my hope that the users' of
CLEW will get a clue about their department!

 The Hackystat-JPL configuration: Overview and initial results.
 Technical Report CSDL-03-07, Department of Information and Computer
  Sciences, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, October 2003.
[&nbsp;<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2003/03-07/03-07.html">.html</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">

This report presents selected initial results from Hackystat-based
descriptive analyses
of Harvest workflow data gathered from the Mission Data System software
development project from January, 2003 to August, 2003.  We present the
motivation for this work, the methods used, examples of the analyses, and
questions raised by the results. Our major findings include: (a) workflow
transitions not documented in the "official" process; (b) significant
numbers of packages with unexpected transition
sequences; (c) cyclical levels of development "intensity" as
represented by levels of promotion/demotion; (d) a possible approach to
calculating the proportion of "new" scheduled work versus rework/unscheduled work
along with baseline values; and
(e) a possible approach to calculating the distribution of package "ages" and days spent in the
various workflow states, along with potential issues with the representation of
"package age" based upon the current approach to package
promotion.

The report illustrates how our current approach to analysis can yield
descriptive perspectives on the MDS development process. It provides a first
step toward more prescriptive, analytic models of the MDS software development
process by providing insights into the potential uses and limitations of MDS
product and process data.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

This report presents the results from a qualitative evaluation of ICS 413
and ICS 613 students at the end of Fall, 2003.  The students had used
Hackystat-UH for approximately six weeks at the time of the evaluation.  The survey requests their
feedback regarding the installation, configuration, overhead of use,
usability, utility, and future use of the Hackystat-UH
configuration. Results provide evidence that: (1) Significant problems
occur during installation and configuration of the system; (2) the
Hackystat-UH configuration incurs very low overhead after completing
installation and configuration; (3) Analyses were generally found to be
somewhat useful and usable; and (4) feasibility in a professional
development context requires addressing privacy and platform issues.

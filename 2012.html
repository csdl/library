<blockquote><font size="-1">

Due to rising costs and the questionable future of our non-renewable energy reserves,
individuals need to become aware of their energy usage. In order to instill these habits earlier,
organizations have held energy competitions to promote the reduction of energy. This also has the
side effect of reducing the energy cost to the organization holding the competition. Typically, these
competitions are held in colleges and universities and there are companies that can provide hardware
and software to support them. However, since such solutions can be expensive, we would like a free,
open source solution that can be used by any organization.
We created Makahiki to be an open source framework for sustainability competitions. We
also designed it to be a platform for researchers to investigate user behaviors during an energy competition. However, in order to validate our design, we need to evaluate and test our design. During
the course of development, we had three evaluation phases. In the mockup phase, we validated our
design before doing any implementation. In the onboarding phase, we investigated how individuals
will interact with the system when they visit it for the first time. Finally, in the beta phase, we simulated the competition on a much smaller scale in order to observe how Makahiki might be used in
an actual competition. Following these evaluations, Makahiki was used to support the 2011 Kukui
Cup, which was held in mid-October.
In summary, we claim the following contributions:
1. An open source system for creating serious games for energy competitions.
2. A research platform on which researchers can observe user behavior during energy competitions.
3. A methodology for evaluating and testing serious games that involve competitions over a
period of time.

 Makahiki: An open source game engine for energy education and
  conservation.

  The rising cost, increasing scarcity, and environmental impact of fossil
  fuels as an energy source makes a transition to cleaner, renewable energy
  sources an international imperative.  This paper presents Makahiki, an open
  source game engine for energy education and conservation. Developed for a
  residence hall energy competition, Makahiki facilitates the implementation of
  &ldquo;serious games&rdquo; that motivate players to learn about energy issues,
  improve their intuition about energy consumption, and understand how to use energy more
  efficiently in their normal life.  Initial deployment of Makahiki at the
  University of Hawaii in Fall 2011 has revealed useful insights into its game
  mechanics, ways to improve the next Kukui Cup challenge, and insights
  into the changes we need to make to better facilitate adaptation to other energy contexts.

 Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to android
  os release life-cycle.

Within the field of software repository mining
(MSR) researchers deal with a problem of discovery of interesting
and actionable information about software projects. It is
a common practice to perform analyzes on the various levels
of abstraction of change events, for example by aggregating
change-events into time-series. Following this, I investigate
the applicability of SAX-based approximation and indexing of
time-series with tf*idf weights in order to discover recurrent
behaviors within development process. The proposed workflow
starts by extracting and aggregating of revision control data
and followed by reduction and transformation of aggregated
data into symbolic space with PAA and SAX. Resulting SAX
words then grouped into dictionaries associated with software
process constraints known to influence behaviors, such as time,
location, employment, etc. These, in turn, are investigated with
the use of tf*idf statistics as a dissimilarity measure in order
to discover behavioral patterns.
As a proof of the concept I have applied this technique to
software process artifact trails corresponding to Android OS1
development, where it was able to discover recurrent behaviors
in the &ldquo;new code lines dynamics&rdquo; before and after release.
By building a classifier upon these behaviors, I was able to
successfully recognize pre- and post-release behaviors within
the same and similar sub-projects of Android OS.

The state of Hawaii is more dependent on oil than any other state in the nation, using it for most electricity generation as well as transportation. The state-sponsored Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative calls for Hawaii to sharply reduce this dependence, obtaining 70 percent of its energy from clean energy sources by 2030. The University of Hawaii is playing a major role in this effort by conducting research, education, and workforce training in energy and sustainability. The project considers both theoretical and practical aspects of response, control and status on a local, interconnected sub-system of the grid and elucidates its behavior when distributed renewable energy sources are added. The result will be a smart, sustainable microgrid. Four interlinked research projects will be integrated into a graduate and undergraduate education program on smart grids, renewable energy, and energy efficiency.

 Beyond kWh: Myths and fixes for energy competition game design.
 In <em>Proceedings of Meaningful Play 2012</em>, pages 1-10, October

  The Kukui Cup project investigates the use of &ldquo;meaningful play&rdquo; to facilitate energy awareness, conservation and behavioral change.  Each Kukui Cup Challenge combines real world and online environments in an attempt to combine information technology, game mechanics, educational pedagogy, and incentives in a synergistic and engaging fashion.  We challenge players to: (1) acquire more sophistication about energy concepts and (2) experiment with new behaviors ranging from micro (such as turning off the lights or installing a CFL) to macro (such as taking energy-related courses, joining environmental groups, and political/social advocacy.)

 To inform the design of the inaugural 2011 Kukui Cup, we relied heavily on prior collegiate energy competitions, of which there have been over 150 in the past few years.  Published accounts of these competitions indicate that they achieve dramatic reductions in energy usage (a median of 22%) and cost savings of tens of thousands of dollars.  In our case, the data collected from the 2011 Kukui Cup was generally in agreement, with observed energy reductions of up to 16% when using data collection and analysis techniques typical to these competitions.  However, our analysis process caused us to look more closely at the methods employed to produce outcome data for energy competitions, with unexpected results.

 We now believe that energy competitions make significant unwarranted assumptions about the data they collect and the way they analyze them, which calls into question both the accuracy of published results from this literature and their effectiveness as serious games.  We believe a closer examination of these issues by the community can help improve the design not only of future energy challenges, but other similar forms of serious games for sustainability.

 In this paper, we describe the Kukui Cup, the design myths it uncovered, and the fixes we propose to improve future forms of meaningful play with respect to energy in particular and serious games in general.

 Encouraging environmental literacy on campus: A case study of the
  kukui cup.

 Environmental literacy measures a person's understanding of ecological
                  principles and the ways in which human systems interact with the
                  environment. It falls on a continuum of varying degrees of aptitude,
                  from nominal to functional to operational, and includes behaviors,
                  attitudes, concerns and knowledge about the environment (Roth,
                  1992). This skill-set comprises both cognitive and affective types of
                  knowledge. A high level of environmental literacy will be necessary to
                  navigate a future in which these skills are needed (King,
                  2000). Unfortunately, only 1-2 percent of American adults are considered
                  environmentally literate (Coyle, 2006).  Environmental education, the
                  key for producing environmentally literate citizens, has been on the
                  rise since it emerged in the 1970s. At the university level, the number
                  of sustainability programs and initiatives is inspiring (Shephard,
                  2006).  However, many of the changes in higher education have been on
                  physical campuses and not inside the classroom, and sustainability is
                  seen more as a prescriptive fix than a radical change in attitude,
                  concern, knowledge and behavior (Sherman, 2008; 2011).  A recent trend
                  on university campuses has been energy-saving competitions in university
                  buildings and on-campus dormitories — over 150 of these competitions
                  have taken place in the last few years, with median energy reductions of
                  22 percent (Johnson et al, 2011). This paper is a case study of one of
                  those competitions: the Kukui Cup at Hawai'i Pacific University
                  (HPU). In the three-weeklong competition, students living on campus
                  played an online game and participated in associated educational
                  activities using resources from the Collaborative Software Design
                  Laboratory at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa. The Kukui Cup was an
                  attempt to use gamification techniques, competition and technology to
                  encourage changes in environmental behaviors, attitudes, concerns and
                  knowledge of oncampus residents, with hopes of improving their overall
                  levels of energy and environmental literacy. This study aims to answer
                  the questions: What is the level of environmental literacy of dorm
                  residents at HPU, and how is it affected by participation in an
                  on-campus energy-saving competition?
